# Dungeons and Dinos

Beat the dinos to get to the dungeon's gem!
<p>In battle, each option has different effects and is more or less effective against the enemy's moves:</p>
* Aggressive beats sneaky
* Defensive beats aggressive
* Sneaky beats defensive
<p>Aggressive attacks will deal 1 or 2 damage against sneaky. Defensive moves will either heal by 1 or deal 1 damage against aggressive. Sneaky can deal 0-3 damage against defensive. Nothing happens on a tie.</p>
