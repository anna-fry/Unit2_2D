# Dungeons and Dinos

Beat the dinos to get to the dungeon's gem!
In battle, each option has different effects, and is more or less effective against the enemy's moves:
  Aggressive beats sneaky
  Defensive beats aggressive
  Sneaky beats defensive
Aggressive attacks will deal 1 or 2 damage against sneaky. Defensive moves will either heal by 1 or deal 1 damage against aggressive. Sneaky can deal 0-3 damage against defensive. Nothing happens on a tie.
